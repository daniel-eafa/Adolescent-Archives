About Adolescent Archives:
Adolescent Archives was founded in 2022 by me, along with 3 other students, who 
are all passionate about advocacy for mental health. The web page, targeted at
our school's community, was a website in which anyone could anonymously post blog
entries: whether they wanted to share something positive or just get something off
of their chest. We utilized the JSON database to store and automate the process of
people uploading their entries.
